# Getting Started with Marathon React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Required Packages

For this app, it requires the following packages to be installed (on top of react)
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer flowbite
npx tailwind init -p

Flowbite is what I used for the cards. I had to modify it to be able to use the card.js for multiple card layouts.
